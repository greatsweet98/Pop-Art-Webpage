                <p class="articletext">Pop culture has ingrained itself into our daily lives. It permeates every aspect of our lives, from social media and fashion to music and movies.
                    However, have you ever given any thought to how pop culture affects society? In reality, pop culture plays a significant impact on how we think, act, and behave.
                    The potential of pop culture to mold our attitudes and views is one of the most important ways it affects society. Certain lifestyles or beliefs are frequently portrayed
                    as attractive or aspirational in popular films and television programs.  For instance, how successful and attractive individuals are portrayed in movies might affect how we define success.
                    In a similar vein, popular media portrayals of certain social concerns have the power to increase awareness and effect social change.
                    Pop culture possesses the ability to mainstream particular actions and viewpoints, increasing their desirability or acceptance in society (Yellowbrick, 2023).
                    Today, we will look into the visual analysis on how pop culture has conceptually changed all types of designs, fashion styles, music compositions, & motion pictures throughout the years.

                <p class="articletext">The study of how current and future challenges might be communicated and resolved via design is the focus of Future Aesthetics.
                    Emerging technology, cultural changes, and changing design languages all have a significant impact on them, and they cross over into other fields.
                    Visions of the future, imaginative ideas, and fresh artistic interpretations fueled by technical breakthroughs are frequently included in future aesthetics.
                    In order to improve our interaction with technology to a new level of comprehension, they are pursuing the possibility of revealing its unseen essence.
                    <br><br>
                    The topic of how to convey and negotiate elements from past to present via design is the focus of Future Aesthetics. By making the unseen visible,
                    it raises our comprehension of technology and our interaction with it to an entirely novel degree. Such a field is becoming more and more necessary,
                    particularly in light of technological advancement. For instance, if you search for motifs that try to represent Artificial Intelligence (AI) in today's design environment,
                    you will primarily encounter images of robotic humans directing fingers at a display or engaging with real-world items in some other way (Patrik Hübner, 2024).
